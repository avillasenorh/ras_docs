# rapidAlignerSeismic Documentation

**rapidAlignerSeismic** is a Python package for aligning seismic waveforms based on their similarity.
It is based on the NVIDIA library [**rapidAligner**](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/aligning-time-series-at-the-speed-of-light/),
a CUDA-accelerated library to align short time series snippets in an exceedingly long stream of time series.

For **rapidAlignerSeismic** the short series snippets (queries) will be earthquake templates,
and the long stream (subject) will be the continuous seismic recording.
